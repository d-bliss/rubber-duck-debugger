# CS50 Rubber Ducky Debugger Extension
A simple Chrome extension to help you debug your code.



## Overview

This extension provides a quick and easy way to debug your code. It contains a simple UI that displays a rubber ducky image and a message, "What's wrong?" to prompt you to start debugging. Inspiration for this mini project came from the Harvard CS50 course where I was first introductd to the concept of rubber duck debugging.
